### Welcome! — I'm Gustavo, a creator of digital solutions and teams.

I'm a Software Developer and IT Consultant, passionate about building technology that drives growth, unlocks new opportunities, and creates a better quality of life — because innovation means nothing if it doesn't respect our time, our families, and our lives beyond work.

Here, I share ideas, insights, and projects that reflect my approach: building with purpose, solving with creativity, and learning together along the way. I believe the best outcomes emerge through collaboration and a deep understanding of technology's real impact.
